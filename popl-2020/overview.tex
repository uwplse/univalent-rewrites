\section{Reuse, Refactoring, \& Repair}

I'll be cute here. Refactoring and repair are just reuse over time.
Transport is super promising for reuse.
Even though it considers only equivalences, you can squint and view a non-semantics-preserving
change as an equivalence.
But there's a big problem:
Referring to the old thing means you always have to keep it around,
so you can't use it for repair.

Instead we can get the same guarantees transport gives us, but use a
program transformation. 
Honestly, let's just throw the three case studies here, they're very easy
to understand and pretty convincing.

\subsection{Reuse}

Taking all of the DEVOID stuff further---where they left off, didn't see it as the same problem,
but it is and we'll show you why and how.

\subsection{Refactoring}

Galois code.

\subsection{Repair}

REPLICA benchmark(s).

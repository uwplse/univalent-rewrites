\paragraph{Proof Reuse}

esp. theorem reuse by proof term transformation, DEVOID, univalent parametricity, transport. \cite{magaud2000changing} have a transformation.
leo congruence tactic and how it relates to Bas' tactic, and how that can be used for automatic transport.

\paragraph{Proof Evolution}

including good design, tactic-heavy style, planning for change

both proof refactoring and repair, and the overlap, and some talk about the distinction if at all or just point to survey paper~\cite{wibergh2019, WhitesidePhD, Dietrich2013, adams2015, Bourke12, Roe2016, robert2018, pumpkinpatch}

\paragraph{Program Evolution}

including a discussion about program repair

\section{Implementation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item LOC for each equiv/structure
\item Implementation concerns, including termination
\item Choosing the swap equivalence
\item Whole-module commands
\item Opaque
\item Preprocess from DEVOID
\item Does the transport automatically, but matching is in general undecidable
\item Tactic decompiler
\item Identity and coherence
\item Search? Or does that go in ``correct art''? And can the equivalence be defined in terms of DepElim, DepConsr, and IdEta? If so, can those be defined by your
      choice of equivalence?
\item Fun eliminators
\item Optimizations
\item Unification and evars
\item Delta, eta
\end{enumerate}

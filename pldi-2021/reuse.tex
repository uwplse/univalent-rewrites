\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:key1}

\toolname is a tool for \textit{proof repair}.
Proof repair is the problem of updating a broken proof in response to a change in a program or specification~\cite{PGL-045, pumpkinpatch}---in the
case of \toolname, a change in a type definition that corresponds to an equivalence (Section~\ref{sec:scope}).

We can view proof repair as a form of 
\textit{proof reuse}~\cite{Ringer2019, felty1994generalization, caplan1995logical, pons2000generalization, johnsen2004theorem}, % TODO consider citation list
or reusing proofs about one specification (say, from another library, or from within the same proof development)
to derive proofs about another specification.
The difference is that in standard proof reuse, both of these specifications continue to exist.
In contrast, proof repair is the process of reusing proofs across \textit{two versions of a single specification},
only one of which---the new version---must continue to exist.
That is, the old version of the specification may be removed after updating proofs to use the new version.

\textbf{Insight 1}:
Proof repair is a form of proof reuse---reusing proofs about one specification to derive proofs about another specification---with 
the additional challenge that one of the specifications may cease to exist (Section~\ref{sec:repair}).
The key to supporting proof repair is to build a proof reuse
tool that can handle that additional challenge (Section~\ref{sec:time}).

\subsection{Scope: Type Equivalences}
\label{sec:scope}

\vspace{-0.3cm}
\caption{Two functions between \lstinline{Old.list} and \lstinline{New.list} (top) that form an equivalence (bottom).}
\label{fig:equivalence}
\end{figure*}

\toolname supports a particular kind of repair: proof repair in response to certain changes in type definitions.
In particular, these changes in type definitions must correspond to \textit{type equivalences}~\cite{univalent2013homotopy},
or pairs of functions that map between two types and are mutual inverses.
Figure~\ref{fig:equivalence} shows a type equivalence between the two versions of \lstinline{list}
from Section~\ref{sec:overview}, Figure~\ref{fig:listswap} that \toolname discovered and proved automatically.
When such a type equivalence between two types exists, we say those types are \textit{equivalent} (denoted $\simeq$), for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
Old.list $\simeq$ New.list
\end{lstlisting}

\toolname further requires that the equivalences it supports are expressed using something called a \textit{configuration}.
At a high level, a configuration is a deconstructed equivalence.
Its purpose is to help the proof term transformation update proof terms across the equivalence in a way that removes
references to the old type (like \lstinline{Old.list}), all the while abstracting away the details specific to any given change in type
(like permuting arguments to induction principles).

In Section~\ref{sec:configurable}, we will define the notion of a configuration more formally.
We will also show that every equivalence induces a configuration, % TODO one lemma missing from this though
though not necessarily one that is suitable for repair (removing references to the old type).
All of the changes from Table~\ref{fig:changes} can be described by configurations in a way that is suitable for repair.
To give some more intuition for what kinds of changes can be described this way, we elaborate on two such changes below.

\subsubsection{Factoring out Constructors}
\label{sec:ex1}

\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}{0.48\columnwidth}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=1, lastline=3]{equiv2.tex}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\columnwidth}
\lstinputlisting[firstline=5, lastline=7]{equiv2.tex}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\caption{The type \lstinline{J} (right) is \lstinline{I} (left) with \lstinline{A} and \lstinline{B} factored out to \lstinline{bool} (Coq standard library).}
\label{fig:equivalence2}
\end{figure}

Consider using \toolname to port functions and proofs across the change from the type \lstinline{I} to the type \lstinline{J} 
in Figure~\ref{fig:equivalence2}.
\lstinline{J} can be viewed as \lstinline{I} with its two constructors \lstinline{A} and \lstinline{B} pulled out to a
new hypothesis of type \lstinline{bool} for a single constructor.

With \toolname, the proof engineer can repair functions and proofs about \lstinline{I} to instead use \lstinline{J},
as long as she first configures \toolname to describe which constructor 
of \lstinline{I} maps to \lstinline{true} and which maps to \lstinline{false}.
This information about constructor mappings induces an equivalence \lstinline{I }$\simeq$\lstinline{ J}
along which \toolname repairs functions and proofs.

The file \href{https://github.com/uwplse/pumpkin-pi/blob/master/plugin/coq/playground/constr_refactor.v}{constr_refactor.v}
shows an example of this, mapping \lstinline{A} to \lstinline{true} and \lstinline{B} to false.
It uses \toolname to automatically repair functions and proofs over \lstinline{I}, like:

\begin{lstlisting}
Theorem demorgan_1 : $\forall$ (i1 i2 : I),(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  neg (and i1 i2) = or (neg i1) (neg i2).(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
Proof.(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  intros i1 i2.(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  induction i1; auto.(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
Qed.
\end{lstlisting}
to corresponding functions and proofs over \lstinline{J}, like:

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=\color{cyan!30}]
Theorem demorgan_1 : $\forall$ (j1 j2 : J),(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  neg (and j1 j2) = or (neg j1) (neg j2).(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
Proof.(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  intros j1 j2.(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  induction j1 (@\codediff{as [b]. induction b as [ | ]}@); auto.(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
Qed.
\end{lstlisting}
These repaired functions and proofs refer to \lstinline{J} in place of \lstinline{I}.
Otherwise, they behave the same way as the functions and proofs over \lstinline{I} up to the equivalence between
\lstinline{I} and \lstinline{J}---Section~\ref{sec:repair} explains this intuition more formally.

\subsubsection{Adding a Dependent Index}
\label{sec:ex2}

Despite the fact that \toolname requires changes to correspond to type equivalences,
\toolname can in fact handle some changes in which the proof engineer adds or removes information.
This is true when it is possible to express those changes as equivalences between \textit{refinements} ($\Sigma$ types).
It is up to the proof engineer to supply the additional information needed to construct proofs about the refinement
(the corresponding projection of the $\Sigma$ type).

%In general, for any change in type definition, there is always \href{https://github.com/uwplse/pumpkin-pi/blob/master/plugin/coq/playground/trivial.v}{a trivial equivalence} between $\Sigma$ types.
%But this trivial equivalence is not useful for proof engineers, since it requires as much information from the proof engineer as just
%writing the new proof from scratch.


\begin{figure*}
\begin{minipage}{0.40\textwidth}
   \lstinputlisting[firstline=1, lastline=4]{listtovect.tex}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.58\textwidth}
   \lstinputlisting[firstline=6, lastline=9]{listtovect.tex}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\caption{A vector (right) is a list (left) indexed by its length.}
\label{fig:listtovect}
\end{figure*}

Practically, the key to handling changes that add or remove information usefully is to separate the new information from redundant old information, 
and include only the new information in the correpsonding projection of the $\Sigma$ type.
Consider, for example, changing a list to a length-indexed vector (Figure~\ref{fig:listtovect}).
An early version of \toolname called \textsc{Devoid}~\cite{Ringer2019} could repair proofs about lists to proofs about \textit{vectors of some length}, since:

\begin{lstlisting}
list T $\simeq$ $\Sigma$(n : nat).vector T n.
\end{lstlisting}
This is enough to automatically repair a lemma about lists:

\begin{lstlisting}
$\forall$ {A B} (l1 : list A) (l2 : list B),(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  zip_with pair l1 l2 = zip l1 l2.
\end{lstlisting}
to a lemma about vectors of some length:

\begin{lstlisting}
$\forall$ {A B} (l1 : (@\codediff{$\Sigma$(n : nat).vector A n}@)) (l2 : (@\codediff{$\Sigma$(n : nat).vector B n}@)),(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  zip_with pair l1 l2 = zip l1 l2.
\end{lstlisting}
recursively updating dependencies \lstinline{zip} and \lstinline{zip_with}.
It is not enough, however, to help the proof engineer get from that to a proof about vectors \textit{of a particular length}:

\begin{lstlisting}
$\forall$ {A B} (@\codediff{n}@) (l1 : (@\codediff{vector A n}@)) (l2 : (@\codediff{vector B n}@)),(@\vspace{-0.04cm}@)
  zip_with pair (@\codediff{n}@) l1 l2 = zip (@\codediff{n}@) l1 l2.
\end{lstlisting}

\textsc{Devoid} leaves this step to the proof engineer.
\toolname, in contrast, can handle this step as well (\href{https://github.com/uwplse/pumpkin-pi/blob/master/plugin/coq/examples/Example.v}{\lstinline{Example.v}}).
The key is to repair functions and proofs across this equivalence:

\begin{lstlisting}
$\Sigma$(l : list T).length l = n $\simeq$ vector T n.
\end{lstlisting}
From the proof engineer's perspective, when the proof engineer changes specifications to refer to \lstinline{vector} instead of \lstinline{list},
to fix her functions and proofs, she must additionally prove invariants about the lengths of her lists.
\toolname makes it easy to separate out that proof obligation, then automates the rest.
Section~\ref{sec:search} shows this and other case studies using \toolname to repair real proofs
informed by the needs of proof engineers.

\subsection{Transport with a Twist}
\label{sec:repair}

Proof repair across type equivalences corresponds to a particular kind of proof reuse called \textit{transport},
with the twist that the specification about which we are reusing proofs may cease to exist.
A transport method takes an input term $t$ and produces an output term $t'$ that is \textit{equal up to transport}
along an equivalence $A \simeq B$ (denoted $t \equiv_{A \simeq B} t'$).
Informally, equality up to transport means that if $t$ is a function, then $t'$ behaves the same way modulo the equivalence;
if $t$ is a proof, then $t'$ proves the same theorem the same way modulo the equivalence.
For example, in Section~\ref{sec:overview}, the original append function \lstinline{++} over \lstinline{Old.list}
and the updated append function \lstinline{++} over \lstinline{New.list} that \toolname produces are
equal up to transport along the equivalence from Figure~\ref{fig:equivalence}, since:

\begin{lstlisting}
$\forall$ T (l1 l2 : Old.list T), swap T (l1 ++ l2) = (swap T l1) ++ (swap T l2).
\end{lstlisting}
by induction and rewriting, and similarly in the opposite direction.
The original \lstinline{rev_app_distr} is equal to the transformed proof along the same equivalence,
since it proves the same thing the same way as the transformed proof up to the same equivalence, and up to the changes in \lstinline{++}
and \lstinline{rev}.

The formal details of equality up to transport in a univalent type theory can be found in \citet{univalent2013homotopy}, and an approximation in Coq without univalence can be found in \citet{tabareau2017equivalences}.
Note that for any equivalent \A and \B, there can be many equivalences $A \simeq B$.
Equality up to transport is along a \textit{particular} equivalence, though we erase this in the notation.

Transport methods typically work by explicitly applying the functions that make up the equivalence to convert
inputs and outputs back and forth between equivalent types.
This approach would not work for repair, since it does not make it possible to remove the old specification.
The goal of a proof repair tool like \toolname is to define a transport method that
can remove references to the old specification, %rather than converting back and forth like standard transport methods.
%That way, the proof repair tool can produce proofs that no longer refer in any way to the old specification,
since the old specification may no longer exist.

Section~\ref{sec:overview} showed a simple case of this: \toolname
reused the proof of \lstinline{rev_app_distr} defined over \lstinline{Old.list}
to generate a new proof of \lstinline{rev_app_distr} defined over equivalent \lstinline{New.list}.
Furthermore, it did so in a way that removed all references to \lstinline{Old.list}, both in the proof
and in its dependencies.
That way, after calling \lstinline{Repair}, \lstinline{Old.list} could be removed.

\subsection{\textsc{Carrot}: A Tool for Proof Repair Across Type Equivalences}
\label{sec:time}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{minipage}{0.52\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{workflowa.pdf}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{workflowb.pdf}
\vspace{0.97cm}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{-0.4cm}
\caption{The two possible workflows for \toolname, using either automatic (left) or manual (right) configuration.}
\label{fig:system}
\end{figure*}

\toolname implements this transport with a twist using a proof term transformation.
The proof term transformation implements transport across equivalences,
but in a way that replaces references to the old specification (in Section~\ref{sec:overview}, the theorem that refers to \lstinline{Old.list})
with references to the new specification (in Section~\ref{sec:overview}, the theorem that refers to \lstinline{New.list}).
This proof term transformation is configurable to a particular equivalence:
it takes a \textit{configuration} (see Section~\ref{sec:configurable}) 
that tells \toolname how to transform certain constructors, eliminators, and equalities that 
correspond to the equivalence.
The configuration can be supplied manually, or discovered automatically by a search procedure.

TODO reash configurations, explain that configurations always induce equivalences, though not always in ways suitable for repair
\toolname further requires that the equivalences it supports are expressed using a particular configuration that we will define in Section~\ref{sec:configurable}. At a high level, this configuration helps the proof term transformation update constructors and eliminators
while maintaining some level of abstraction... etc. make this the focus, call it out as the sort of key trick.

Figure~\ref{fig:system} shows how this comes together when the proof engineer invokes \toolname:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \toolname configures itself, either:
\begin{enumerate}
\item automatically (left), using \textbf{Configure} to discover the configuration, or
\item manually (right), by taking the configuration as an argument.
\end{enumerate}
\item The configured \textbf{Transform} transforms the old proof term into the new proof term.
\item \textbf{Decompile} produces a new proof script from the new proof term.
\end{enumerate}

The example in Section~\ref{sec:overview} uses automatic configuration. When we run the \lstinline{Repair} command,
\textbf{Configure} invokes a search procedure that automatically proves the equivalence in Figure~\ref{fig:equivalence},
then configures \textbf{Transform} using that equivalence.
\textbf{Transform} then ports the proof term that inducted over \lstinline{Old.list}
to induct over \lstinline{New.list}, and finally
\textbf{Decompile} produces the tactic script in Figure~\ref{fig:auto}.

There are currently four search procedures for automatic configuration implemented in \toolname,
all informed by the needs of real proof engineers:

\begin{enumerate}
\item porting between tuples and records,
\item renaming and permuting constructors of inductive types,
\item porting along algebraic ornaments to types at \textit{some} index (from \textsc{Devoid}), and
\item unpacking types at \textit{some} index to a \textit{particular} index.
\end{enumerate}
All four search procedures generate equivalence proofs as in Figure~\ref{fig:equivalence} automatically (\href{https://github.com/uwplse/pumpkin-pi/blob/master/plugin/src/automation/search/search.ml}{search.ml} and \href{https://github.com/uwplse/pumpkin-pi/blob/master/plugin/src/automation/search/equivalence.ml}{equivalence.ml}),
then configure (\href{https://github.com/uwplse/pumpkin-pi/blob/master/plugin/src/automation/lift/liftconfig.ml}{liftconfig.ml}) the transformation to those equivalences.
Manual configuration makes it possible
for the proof engineer to directly configure the transformation to a particular equivalence
when a search procedure for that equivalence is not yet implemented.
Section~\ref{sec:search} shows examples of both workflows applied to real proof reuse and repair scenarios.
